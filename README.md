# TetrisGame
This is a crappy version of Tetris I made in Highschool using the Greenfoot IDE

This was made in my Senior year of highschool for my final project.

Have to use a very long command which I am sure no one wants to look up.
The Jar file allows the game to run without having to have the Greenfoot IDE.
It is just the compiled version of the game.

Here is a link to the online version which is easiest to access:
